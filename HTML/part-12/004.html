What are Emojis?
Emojis look like images, or icons, but they are not.

They are letters (characters) from the UTF-8 (Unicode) character set.

UTF-8 covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

The HTML charset Attribute
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know the character set used in the page.

This is specified in the <meta> tag:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
If not specified, UTF-8 is the default character set in HTML.

UTF-8 Characters
Many UTF-8 characters cannot be typed on a keyboard, but they can always be displayed using numbers (called entity numbers):

A is 65
B is 66
C is 67
Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>
<body>

<p>I will display A B C</p>
<p>I will display &#65; &#66; &#67;</p>

</body>
</html>
