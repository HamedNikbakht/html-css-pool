Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

The <section> element defines section in a document.

Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!

So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <section> elements.
